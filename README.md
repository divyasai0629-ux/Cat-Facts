🐾 Cat Facts & Currency Converter: An API-Powered Web App
Check out the live deployment here: Live Demo

🌟 Overview

This project is a dynamic web application that demonstrates the practical application of REST APIs and Asynchronous JavaScript (Promises/Async-Await). Built during my B.Tech CSE 2nd year, it serves as a dual-purpose tool: providing random facts about cats and a real-time currency conversion interface.

🚀 Technical Highlights

API Integration: Successfully integrated multiple public APIs to fetch and display real-time data dynamically.

Asynchronous Programming: Utilized fetch and async/await to handle network requests efficiently without blocking the main UI thread.

Error Handling: Implemented robust error-handling mechanisms to manage failed API calls or network latencies.

Modular Codebase: Developed with a clear separation of concerns, using dedicated JavaScript files for different features (e.g., app.js for facts and currency.js for financial logic).

🛠️ Tech Stack

Frontend: HTML5, CSS3 (Modern, responsive layout).

Logic: JavaScript (ES6+), Fetch API.

Deployment: GitHub Pages.

📈 Key Learning Outcomes

Data Parsing: Gained experience in parsing JSON responses from external servers.

UI/UX Optimization: Focused on creating a clean, user-friendly interface that updates content without full page refreshes.

State Management: Managed local state to reflect real-time changes in currency rates and fact generation.
